### nvm (Node Version Manager)
Install nvm on **unix** or **macOS** systems by following this installation guide: https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm#installing-and-updating

To install nvm on a **Windows** system download and run the **nvm-setup.exe** from the following: https://github.com/coreybutler/nvm-windows/releases

### Node.js and npm
Install Node.js depending on the supported Node.js version of the current Angular version. For reference see: https://angular.io/guide/versions

Node.js can be installed via the following command and change the version accordingly if needed (npm will be installed automatically with Node.js):
```bash
nvm install 18.18.2
```

Check your installation and version of Node.js and npm with the following commands:
```bash
node -v
```
```bash
npm -v
```

If you have a different Node.js version on your system you can change the used version via the following command (change the version accordingly):
```bash
nvm use 18.18.2
```

### Angular CLI
Install the Angular CLI with the following command:
```bash
npm install -g @angular/cli
```

Check your version of the Angular CLI with the following command:
```bash
ng version
```

The port is the same as the port your Spring application is running on.

http://localhost:8080/h2-console
